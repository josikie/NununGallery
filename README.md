# Nunun Gallery

I've been learning stateful and stateless on Jetpack Compose from AndroidDev's course by Google. The challenge is to create an art space app. I created my cat's gallery app.
This app is very simple. It contains one portrait, three texts, and two beautiful buttons (the previous and next buttons). You can tap the button to see another my cute cat faces.
Here is the screenshot:

If you are too lazy to compile it yourself, download the .apk here (it is safe): https://josikie.com/download/galeri-nunun/
